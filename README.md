# Shorts-Recommender-System
Build a Video Recommender System’s back-end infrastructure along with UI, enabling data processing and recommendation functionality.
## Learnings :
• Curated a videos dataset (shorts_dataset.csv) , enhancing it with Natural Language Processing (NLP)
techniques for descriptive video tags.<br>
• Employed vectorization method to create high-dimensional vectors from tags,
enabling precise content analysis by calculating cosine similarities, ensuring
recommended videos matches user preferences. (MinorProject - Jupyter Source File) <br>
• User-Centric Recommendation Engine: Developed a dynamic Python-based
recommendation system using Streamlit, personalized through userfeedback. (Python-app: Code of the app using streamlit.)
